    "description":"__What are teams used for?__\n\u279d Teams are used for dungeon battling A.I. opponents (command: ``.dg bt``), team-fighting against your friends (command: ``.dg fight <tag friend here>``) and most importantly, raiding. (Follow this guide to make your very first team, and then you'll learn how to raid using one of our guides.)\n\n__How do I make a team?__\n\u279d First of all, decide on a name. Your team name must be under 15 characters, and cannot contain special symbols. You cannot create a team with the same name as well.\n\n\u279d Once you have decided on a name, it's now time to make your very first team! Simply type ``.team create <team name>`` and voila, you have created your very first team.\n\n__How do I add cards into my team?__\n\u279d A team is not complete without members in it. A team in AniGame limits you to have **3** characters in it. Of course, you can change your team comp whenever you want. \n\n\u279d Once you have **3** characters ready, use ``.team set <card no. from the inventory>``. And from there on out, follow the instructions shown on screen once the command is executed.\n\n\u279d Do this to the other **2** character cards you wish to have in your team. Once it's done, use ``.team select <team name (case sensitive)>`` to select your team. And there you go, your team is now complete!\n\n__How do I view my team?__\n\u279d When you have a team selected, using ``.team`` will view the selected team and it's stats.\n\n\u279d If you want to view another team from your teams, simply use ``.team view <team name (case sensitive)>`` to view it."
