	          <h2>Farming</h2>
	          <ul>
	            <li>For Fast Fort Solgres runs, do Howzer, Guilia, Gowther, Green Merlin on red evolution books, Guilia gets an ulti orb if she isn't damaged, and Gowther gets the team have a whole atk buff every turn he's not damage for a limit of 5 turns, being that you'll clear each wave in one turn (not hit at all) because of this, the team have really good synergy and the fastest clear times depending on your own setup and gear.</li>
	            <li>Howzer can solo most content if he's properly invested. Use him solo to farm easy stages. He have a whole AOE Skill Set.</li>
	            <li>To build your farm team, choose from these, Glizhawk, Weindhart, SR Guilia, Gowther and Twiggo, check their skills, passives and synergy with each other, then decide. Howzer should always be on farm team if possible, for sub slots you either want to have an unit to level or units like red jericho, or green merlin for fast clearings.</li>
	          </ul>

	        <article id = "goldwhere">
	          <h2>Where to Farm Gold</h2>
	          <ul>
	            <li>The fastest and more reliable way to get a lot of money is auto farming books 24/7 on Fort Solgres 50% OFF Stamina, which is why you need a fast and reliable auto farming team also, for these discounted stamina events.</li>
	            <li>RAIDS, if you only do extreme raids, and have fast clearing times, on non stamina off days you can focus on spamming some, besides the Boss Battles and Raids, giving a lot of money, as drops you can get a bunch of SSR Chests, so if you can, complete a few chapters on boss battles per day so you can get chalices, gold, SSR chests, awakening stones, SR gear, awakening mats. To maximize your gold gains, always use gold food on boss battles and raids.</li>
	            <li>Fort Solgres Gold dungeons, always do the gold dungeons, they are limited, after clearing them, invite Veronica and get a 20% more of money per SSR chest.</li>
	            <li>Hawk's sales, level the 4k foods to lvl 5, and fill your 5 spots with them.</li>
	          </ul>
	        </article>
	        <article id = "foodwhat">
	          <h2>What Food to Farm</h2>
	          <ul>
	            <li>PVP Coins Food</li>
	            <li>Gold Food</li>
	            <li>Hawk's Sales food till lvl 5</li>
	            <li>Affinity food, for your main team</li>
	            <li>For PVP high ranks. Evasion, Ulti+1, Atk, Hp food is popular decide which one is best for your team.</li>
	          </ul>
	        </article>
	        <article id = "anvilsawakeningwhere">
	          <h2>Where to Farm Anvils & Awakening Stones</h2>
	          <ul>
	            <li>Salvaging your gear nets you a really neat amount of Awakening stones. +1 Gives more Red Stones, +5 Gives more Blue Stones, so +5 your SSR Gear and +1 the rest before salvaging for best efficiency as well as time.</li>
	            <li>Raids, like many other stuff you can get 5* or 4* awakening with them, and you can spam them without stamina too.</li>
	            <li>Guild Boss for 50 weekly anvils.</li>
	            <li>PVP for 100 weekly anvils, use coin food.</li>
	            <li>Weapon Gacha for Anvils, awakening stone and gear, but don't do this, unless you can spare it, wait for event (Like the Salvaging Event), unless you are in a rush, is still not a bad place to spend money.</li>

	              <li>Just buy units that you'll be using a lot on PVP (AND NOT IN GENERAL POOL), or on a lot of content. Like Gowther, Blue King or Green Merlin. CSBan is not really an unit you want to max its ulti.</li>

	        </article>
	        <article id = "gearwhat">
	          <h2>What Specialized Gear Sets to Build</h2>
	          <ul>
	            <li>1 CDMG Set, Ring and Bracer Ideally, either ATK or CDMG sub stats, but be sure that these stats are over 80%. Optionally you can get the whole set Belt, Rune, Necklace and Earring.</li>
	            <li>1 or 2 DEF/DEF/DEF Same as above you can go with either Defense or Resistance sub stats, when you're done with that, you can worry about min maxing.</li>
	            <li>1 or 2 Pierce Sub Stats Sets, there's more variety here it can work with ATK/DEF, ATK/CDMG for Howzer, HP/DEF sets for Gustav or if you want a CC Stick on Howzer.</li>
	            <li>Positioning of your gear matters, for instance Ring and Bracer is ideal on CDMG DPS because then it would be much simpler to exchange and it's already built like you want the Crit DPS to work, is hard to explain, but it do matter, but it vary from person to person, so adapt yourself, and proceed with what you have.</li>
