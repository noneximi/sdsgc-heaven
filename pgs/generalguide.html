          <h2>Cosmetics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't buy cosmetics, farm them.</li>
            <li>Max affinity of your main characters.</li>
            <li>Get other character versions to UR or SSR to get their costumes.</li>
            <li>Buy SR and SSR weapons in pop up shop that are bought for gold. Get 40% discount before buying, raids plus 30k donations in town, they cost 300k for SSR and 150k for SR with discount.</li>
            <li>If you already got everything you could on the character via Evolve, Affinity and Pop-UP shop, consider getting some UR cosmetics for those characters that don't have many cosmetics.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "pvptips">
          <h2>PVP</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Always use pvp coin food, unless you climbing to champ 1 on ungeared and need actual food, or if you trying to climb to challenger on geared to secure some weekly pvp coins.</li>
            <li>Stacking Passives work really good on pvp teams. Consider using guild boss Gowther gear in pvp, it works. Gowther gets a party buff every time he doesn't receive damage. So don't ignore the opponent Gowther either.</li>
            <li>Buy the Anvils first, weapons if you need them for ungeared or units like Jericho, Gmerlin, Guilia to increase your efficiency on other content, aim for 5/5, but anvils is the priority.</li>
            <li>Consider getting SSR CDMG Gear for Bracer and Ring, then if you want 3 CDMG SET, consider getting the rest.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "townstips">
          <h2>Town Donations and Shops</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Donate 30k on a town after clearing raid, now everything is on 40% OFF.</li>
            <li>You can now proceed to buy Food Materials, which are cheap, I really recommend doing this on all towns, over time is a better option that farming every food. Long term you wouldn't need to worry about farming food mats for affinity.</li>
            <li>If you have enough gold, buying awakening materials on offer is also worth, those that you have on low quantity.</li>
            <li>Buying chalices is also another option, it goes up to 7m for 3 6* Chalices, it may be worth if you have enough money, not a priority.</li>
            <li>28 Guild Coins (on lvl 7) per day by just playing and donating is not half bad for your own progression, is a win-win.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "ultimatestips">
          <h2>Character Ultimate Levels</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>For PVP this is extremly important in most cases, it can be the deciding factor on ungeared or geared, Good units to max are Blue King, Red Gowther, Green Merlin, Red Howzer, Red Arthur, Red Helbram, Blue Diane, Green Escanor, etc. For a variety of reasons, some work really good on ult rush comps, like Kingbram, Howzer, or some are just really good like Green Merlin, she's useful anywhere as well as Gowther, depending on how you build Gowther it can one shot some teams, Arthur is an amazing link unit for Merlin and is also a really good CC Staple with a really strong ultimate, etc. The decision depends on what you run and what's your aim for your team.</li>
            <li>SR Units are really easy to 6/6 and they will be your main association for a long time, till you get other SSR 6/6. Maxed, so consider investing on good SR associations for your main team.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "farmingtips">
          <h2>Farming</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>For Fast Fort Solgres runs, do Howzer, Guilia, Gowther, Green Merlin on red evolution books, Guilia gets an ulti orb if she isn't damaged, and Gowther gets the team have a whole atk buff every turn he's not damage for a limit of 5 turns, being that you'll clear each wave in one turn (not hit at all) because of this, the team have really good synergy and the fastest clear times depending on your own setup and gear.</li>
            <li>Howzer can solo most content if he's properly invested. Use him solo to farm easy stages. He have a whole AOE Skill Set.</li>
            <li>To build your farm team, choose from these, Glizhawk, Weindhart, SR Guilia, Gowther and Twiggo, check their skills, passives and synergy with each other, then decide. Howzer should always be on farm team if possible, for sub slots you either want to have an unit to level or units like red jericho, or green merlin for fast clearings.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "positioningtips">
          <h2>Positioning</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Card draw is predetermined for the first turn so that you will always mirror your card draw.</li>
            <li>If you get a slot 1 draw, then your ally will also get a slot 1 draw. If you get a slot 2 draw then your ally will also get a slot 2 draw and so on.</li>
            <li>So to maximise the chances, it's best to stagger your DPS and Gowther in the first slots to increase the likelihood of getting good RNG.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "raidexttips">
          <h2>Raid Exchange</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>So basically, you spawn 3 raids, while you partner also spawn 3 raids, then you two do these 6 raids at once. Without having to worry about changing equipment or about your partner composition. You can then do 3 more if you two want, or over the day. You can do 6 at once each if you wish, but talk it out with your partner first.</li>
            <li>Is the fastest way and most efficient way to approach this that nets the most gains in short time without stressing you out, asking for raids every boss you spawn, or doing it with randoms and stressing over their performance. It can really burn you out.</li>
            <li>After you finish the raids you can go clear the shops, if your partner did 3 different chapters than you, you can also clear all of them with 40% OFF for food mats, pop up shop weapon, awakening stones if you need them or chalices, etc.</li>
            <li>So having or asking for a partner to exchange raids with is much more stress free than do them separately, you just need to coordinate once about the partner team, and then you can proceed with the same strategy the whole run. Making it much faster and tolerable while also increasing your overall farming speed and efficiency.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "goldwhere">
          <h2>Where to Farm Gold</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The fastest and more reliable way to get a lot of money is auto farming books 24/7 on Fort Solgres 50% OFF Stamina, which is why you need a fast and reliable auto farming team also, for these discounted stamina events.</li>
            <li>RAIDS, if you only do extreme raids, and have fast clearing times, on non stamina off days you can focus on spamming some, besides the Boss Battles and Raids, giving a lot of money, as drops you can get a bunch of SSR Chests, so if you can, complete a few chapters on boss battles per day so you can get chalices, gold, SSR chests, awakening stones, SR gear, awakening mats. To maximize your gold gains, always use gold food on boss battles and raids.</li>
            <li>Fort Solgres Gold dungeons, always do the gold dungeons, they are limited, after clearing them, invite Veronica and get a 20% more of money per SSR chest.</li>
            <li>Hawk's sales, level the 4k foods to lvl 5, and fill your 5 spots with them.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "foodwhat">
          <h2>What Food to Farm</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>PVP Coins Food</li>
            <li>Gold Food</li>
            <li>Hawk's Sales food till lvl 5</li>
            <li>Affinity food, for your main team</li>
            <li>For PVP high ranks. Evasion, Ulti+1, Atk, Hp food is popular decide which one is best for your team.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "gtipsbox" id = "anvilsawakeningwhere">
          <h2>Where to Farm Anvils & Awakening Stones</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Salvaging your gear nets you a really neat amount of Awakening stones. +1 Gives more Red Stones, +5 Gives more Blue Stones, so +5 your SSR Gear and +1 the rest before salvaging for best efficiency as well as time.</li>
            <li>Raids, like many other stuff you can get 5* or 4* awakening with them, and you can spam them without stamina too.</li>
            <li>Guild Boss for 50 weekly anvils.</li>
            <li>PVP for 100 weekly anvils, use coin food.</li>
            <li>Weapon Gacha for Anvils, awakening stone and gear, but don't do this, unless you can spare it, wait for event (Like the Salvaging Event), unless you are in a rush, is still not a bad place to spend money.</li>

          <h2>What Specialized Gear Sets to Build</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 CDMG Set, Ring and Bracer Ideally, either ATK or CDMG sub stats, but be sure that these stats are over 80%. Optionally you can get the whole set Belt, Rune, Necklace and Earring.</li>
            <li>1 or 2 DEF/DEF/DEF Same as above you can go with either Defense or Resistance sub stats, when you're done with that, you can worry about min maxing.</li>
            <li>1 or 2 Pierce Sub Stats Sets, there's more variety here it can work with ATK/DEF, ATK/CDMG for Howzer, HP/DEF sets for Gustav or if you want a CC Stick on Howzer.</li>
            <li>Positioning of your gear matters, for instance Ring and Bracer is ideal on CDMG DPS because then it would be much simpler to exchange and it's already built like you want the Crit DPS to work, is hard to explain, but it do matter, but it vary from person to person, so adapt yourself, and proceed with what you have.</li>
