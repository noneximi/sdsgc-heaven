        <h1>Crimson Extreme Guide: Jericho & Red Slater Strategy</h1>

        <div class = "crimbox" id = "setup">
          <p>Jericho is still viable in Crimson but similar to Red Extreme, it requires a bit of setup with a great SR unit, Red Slater.</p>
          <p>We'll be using Red Slater passive to mitigate the boss high Critical Resistance. I have tested both Critical gear set with Critical sub stats and DEF/HP set with Critical sub stats and found no substantial difference between the two in terms of achieving 100% Critical on Jericho.</p>
          <p>With close to perfect subs on C gear, Slater is able to hit 100% Critical chance with Critical food and is able to bypass the high resistance which will allow Jericho to hit 100% Critical from the start of the game.</p>
          <p>Jericho on the other hands requires ATK/CD set. CD gear can be easily purchased from PvP arena for coins.</p>
          <p>It's best to stack your Jericho with as much ATK or CD as possible but aiming for 10k+ ATK will guarantee that you can 1 shot the boss with a gold red card with Hellbram Buff.</p>
          <p>Remember to utilize a Guila for the highest damamge possible on your ult and for the +280 attack link bonus.</p>
          <p>The key to doing as much damage as possible is by using her S2 weak point card. Crimson takes extra damage from weak point attacks and buffs stack every hit done, so having a single high damage hit is the key to killing him in one turn.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "crimbox" id = "teams">
          <p>The Ideal Strategy for a Carry is Gowther, Red Slater and Jericho.</p>
          <p>For Supports, Hellbram/Gilthunder/Arthur all work with Gowther and either a 2nd Jeri or Gmerlin for more survivability.</p>
          <p>In terms of optimal buffers, Hellbram gives the best damage boost followed by Gil then Arthur.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "crimbox" id = "strategy">
          <dl>
            <dt>Phase 1</dt>
            <dd>Stall (Use 2 trash cards and swap a Jericho card without using it, so you also charge the Ultimate) and hope for a Gowther Silver Rank Up Card or a Jericho Damaging Card on next turn. Use Slater Debuff and move or combine cards. Do not rank up turn 1.</dd>
            <dd>You can attack 2-3 times but make sure to not stack his passive too high otherwise he can kill you.</dd>
            <dd>After you tank his first phase, either force a rank up on the buff or utilize the Gowther Silver + bronze to get all golds and Debuff + kill with Jericho.</dd>
            <dt>Phase 2</dt>
            <dd>Should be beatable with Jericho Debuff + Damaging Skill, try and stack as much Jericho ult gauges as possible so you can use the Ultimate to kill in the final phase.</dd>
            <dt>Phase 3</dt>
            <dd>Please ensure you have Helbram or Gil Buff before pushing through. The boss will start with an insane amount of stats so either use Jeri cards before you ult to stack her passive or use a Helbram buff to overshoot his resistance.</dd>
