	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Always eat pvp coin food, unless you're climbing to Champion 1 in ungeared and need actual food, or you're trying to climb to Challenger in geared to secure some weekly pvp coins.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Stacking Passives work really good on pvp teams. Consider using guild boss Gowther gear in pvp, it works. Gowther gets a party buff every time he doesn't receive damage. Don't ignore the opponent Gowther either!</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Buy Anvils first, weapons if you need them for ungeared or for units like Jericho, Green Merlin, or Guila to increase your efficiency in other content. Aim for 5/5 cosmetics, but anvils are the priority.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Consider getting SSR CDMG Gear for Bracer and Ring, then if you want a 3 CDMG SET, consider getting the rest.</li>

	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Donate 30k to towns after clearing their raid, for the 40% shop discount.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Then proceed to buy Food Materials, which are cheap. I really recommend doing this in all towns, over time it's a better option than farming every food. Eventually you won't need to worry about farming food mats for affinity.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>If you have enough gold, it's also worthwhile buying awakening materials, those that you have on low quantity.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Buying chalices is also another option, it runs up to 7Million for three 6<i class="far fa-star"></i> Chalices. It may be worth it if you have enough money, although it's not a priority.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>32 Guild Coins (Level 8 Guild) per day by just playing and donating is not half bad for your own progression, it's a win-win.</li>

	          <h2>Character Ultimate Levels</h2>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For PVP this is extremly important. In most cases, it can be the deciding factor in ungeared or geared. Good units to max are Blue King, Red Gowther, Green Merlin, Red Howzer, Red Arthur, Red Helbram, Blue Diane, Green Escanor, etc. For a variety of reasons, some work really good in ult rush comps, like Kingbram, Howzer; some are just really good like Green Merlin, she's useful anywhere, RGowther as well. Depending on how you build Gowther his ulti can one shot some teams. Arthur is an amazing link unit for Merlin and is also a really good CC Staple with a really strong ultimate, etc. The decision depends on what you run and what's your aim for your team.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>SR Units are really easy to 6/6 and they will be your main association for a long time until you get other SSRs to 6/6, so consider investing on good SR associations for your main team.</li>
	          </ul>

	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Card draw is predetermined for the first turn so that you will always mirror your ally's card draw.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>If you get a slot 1 draw, then your ally will also get a slot 1 draw. If you get a slot 2 draw then your ally will also get a slot 2 draw and so on.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>To maximise the chance of a rank up, it's best to stagger your DPS and Gowther in slots 1 and 2 to increase the likelihood of getting good RNG. This means that if you have Gowther in slot 1, your ally should have their Gowther in slot 2 or 3</li>

	        <article id = "raidexttips">
	          <h2>Raid Exchange</h2>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Basically, you spawn 3 raids while you partner also spawn 3 raids. Then you two do these 6 raids at once without having to worry about changing equipment or about your partner's team comp. You can then do 6 more if you two want, or over the day.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>This is the fastest and most efficient way to approach raids; it nets the most gains and without stressing you out, asking for raids every boss you spawn, or doing it with randoms and stressing over their performance. It can really burn you out.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>After you finish the raids you can go clear the shops. If your partner did 3 different chapters from you, you can clear all of them with a 40% discount for food mats, pop up shop weapon, awakening mats, etc.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Having or asking for a partner to exchange raids with is much more stress-free than doing them separately. You just need to coordinate once with team comps, then you can proceed with the same strategy for the whole run, making it much faster and tolerable while also increasing your overall farming efficiency.</li>
