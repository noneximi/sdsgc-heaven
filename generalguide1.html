	          <h2>Gear Progression: Systematic Guide</h2>
						<h3>Phase 1</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>SSR 0* +5 Gear on left and C/R 5* on right for main units, focus on HP/DEF sets and a few ATK/DEF sets</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For C/R gear (right side), re roll for over 14% ATK/DEF/HP sub stats on each piece, auto this, as a tip, stop the auto if you're not getting the sub stat you want</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>It should cost around 400K Gold for Each C piece on average and around 1.4M Gold for R gear piece</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>In-between: Farm for gear over 90% MAIN STATS, this will become even more important later on</li>
	          </ul>
						<h3>Phase 2</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>SSR Gear 5* +5 on Bracer and Belt on your front units, do Necklace as well, but don't re roll them with anvils until you're done with the top and bottom gear re rolls</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>In-between: For associations, do the same as you once did for your main units, SSR 0* +5 on left and C/R 5* on right with over 14% sub stats per piece</li>
	          </ul>
						<h3>Phase 3</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Re roll for sub stats over 2% per slot for your top and bottom gear on your four main units</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>In-between 5* +5 your associations left gear, don't bother about sub stats re rolls just yet. You could also work on specialized builds</li>
	          </ul>
						<h3>Phase 4 & 5</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Re roll your gear for around 2.5% sub stats per piece on top and bottom gear, roll either resistance or defense (with whatever %) on your necklace</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Work (5* +5 and all steps) on your right main units top and bottom SSR gear, BUT, you need a decent amount of anvils to re roll these with decent amount of sub stats</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>In between If you have anvils to spare, work on your associations left top and bottom gear, don't aim for any %, just unlock ATK and HP sub stats, then, work on your necklace with either resistance or defense as well.</li>
	          </ul>
						<h3>Phase 6</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>At this point you should be able to fully build a few SSR sets for all your main units, with over 2.5% sub stats, on top and bottom gear, following this, feel free to use hammers on 100% success events to fully max out your gear</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Fully build 8 hp/def sets</li>

	          <h2>Box CP General Tips</h2>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For Box CP, anyone can reach at least 1.75m at this point in the game, here are some tips that helped me reach 2m Box CP easily</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Go by the basics, check every unit you have, if you have the resources increase all your R units to 6/6 and SR as well, but give priority to Reverse Stages, Associations, TC, Core units,  that's 400 CP per ulti level. Then Check their unique, unlock all of them, that's 400 more CP</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Unlock affinity for most of your units, if you unlock affinity for one unit it can open up for 3 units or more, units like howzer griamore or jericho have many variations so that means more increase on CP</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Affection is also important as an end game source of gems, by unlocking hearts you get 5 diamond per 5 hearts and 10 per 25 hearths filled</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>To farm food you either farm it with normal stamina every day a bit, or are constant and buy them from the town shop every day after the raid discount. If you only buy the food mats and not the awakening mats, theres no need to donate 30k to the town for the discount, otherwise you losing money</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Awaken your units, use most of your mats, most people have lots of 1* and 2* awakening mats anyhow</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Level all your units, UR is not a must, but SSR is easy enough, first level all your units!! If they are not then farm enhance potions on farm day, or use your keys for enhance dungeon. You can get increases as big as over 10k CP</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>The easiest way to get Box CP is simply gearing every unit with HP/DEF sets, you can buy C or R gear if you can afford it. For even bigger increase on CP, awaken (Common or Rare Gear) all of the <strong>Runes and Belts</strong> to 2 or 3* and reroll the substats to 12% or over. Which should be cheap enough. (Note that 5* with good sub stats should net a bigger increase than SSR 0* +5, but more costly on red stones)</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Alternatively you can hoard some HP DEF SSR gear by farming, equipping and +5ing (Not Awaken) all of them. Then you can salvage all of them (with bad main stats) on salvage day</li>

	          <h2>Team CP General Tips</h2>
						<h3>Associations</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>About Team CP, first of all I'll start with... don't forget your assosiations have feeling too!</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Seriously tho, don't forget about your assosiations that are a vital part of your teams. Some basic tips for starters</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For Associations <strong>always</strong> go for gear with ATK DEF and HP substats all other stats don't carry to the main unit, only basic stats.</li>
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For Associations prioritize 6/6 or close to it, always prefer combo fate link units. First ask yourself what does you main unit needs, then look at the base stats of your association and then decide which substat scales the best, for instance:
								<ul class="fa-ul">
			            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i></span>Howzer scales much better with HP, so give him HP gear and you can see some crazy numbers</li>
									<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i></span>Escanor is the biggest CP currently on Global so anything works and you can see some crazy increases on your main unit</li>
									<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i></span>Jericho and Red SSR Guilia are one of the biggest ATK units on Global so giving them good ATK gear can give the main unit noticeable increases as well</li>
			          </ul></li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Links that increase stats like +280 atk or hp are preferred as long as said unit is 6/6 or close to</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Always check what your main unit needs the most and which unit can give the best gains to it</li>
	          </ul>
						<h3>Def vs Res</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>DEF gives the most CP but is not a lot by any means but <strong>it's the most consistent</strong></li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>RES is good on your <strong>front</strong> units depending on your base stats (Gmerlin, Gowther, Valnety, Escanor are good examples) while planning to hit patience</li>
	          </ul>
						<h3>Main Units</h3>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>CP is based on the biggest number. Gear based is like this... Belt > Rune > Bracer > Ring > Neklace > Earrings</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>It also hold true to units, so for your max CP team, sort all units with CP and look the ones you have built that have the biggest base CP. (Refer to Database app to sort units)</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Escanor is an obvious choice</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Ultimate levels add 400 CP point per Ulti level, UR Cosmetics add another good base stats</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For gear prioritize Belt/Rune and Bracer/Ring First depending,  then you can work on the rest. For re rolling you need anvils and how you get anvils?
								<ul class="fa-ul">
			            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i></span>PVP you can get up to 200 weekly anvils if you also farm coins  after climbing to challenger</li>
									<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i></span>For PVP Teams, per week ask around, No need of big Whale CP to reach challenger each week</li>
									<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-moon"></i></span>Guild Boss! Easy to get 100 Weekly Anvils</li>
			          </ul></li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Gear Gacha holds hammers and anvils so if you farmed enough gold, feel free to do a few rolls</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Training Cave also hold Engraving Stones, Hammers and Anvils, so don't forget to do them weekly as well! If you worked on your box you should have no problems to clear and auto most fights if not the case, ask for help</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>If you're rerolling, there's no need to aim further than 2.5% substats, hammers exist. PRO TIP: If you're not getting the substat you want at all, stop the auto, and start again</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>So basically if you're committed enough you can farm at least 300 anvils per week, OR WHALE</li>

	          <h2>Preferred Gear for Content</h2>
	          <ul class="fa-ul">
	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Content is on an HP based era, most content like FBG and GB are HP based, you do need DPS check regardless, Box CP gives you a great adv in both CP and score</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For Gear on overall content, 4 ATK/DEF Sets (Which most people already have)</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>4 HP DEF Gear, Endgame 8 HP/def sets</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For Assosiations if you just need HP remember you can just use Common/rare Belt and Rune awakened</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Specialized Gear for Valenty and/or Gowther with resistance substats on a <strong>DEF Neklace and Earring</strong> So you have the possibility to change from HP/DEF to ATK/DEF with ease and with just one set</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Specialized gear for Lilia <strong>DEF Bracer and Ring</strong> with pierce substats this so you can change to ATK/DEF or HP/DEF with ease</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Note: You can also use her with ATK substats on different teams, depends on what works with you better</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>Normally using a DEF bracer and Ring or Def belt and rune  allows you to have many different gear options while conserving your high rolls and exchanging between gear sets</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For UR Gear it may be smart to use BDmeliodas with ATK substats if you're also running Blilia, for Both CP and better efficency with the rest of Meliodas units (namely LV Meli)</li>
							<li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>The Pierce meta is slowly dying, and it will go to some shifts, if you build another pierce gear, make it so thinking primarily on farming</li>

	            <li><span class = "fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i></span>For PVP this is extremly important. In most cases, it can be the deciding factor in ungeared or geared. Good units to max are Blue King, Red Gowther, Green Merlin, Red Howzer, Red Arthur, Red Helbram, Blue Diane, Green Escanor, etc. For a variety of reasons, some work really good in ult rush comps, like Kingbram, Howzer; some are just really good like Green Merlin, she's useful anywhere, RGowther as well. Depending on how you build Gowther his ulti can one shot some teams. Arthur is an amazing link unit for Merlin and is also a really good CC Staple with a really strong ultimate, etc. The decision depends on what you run and what's your aim for your team.</li>
